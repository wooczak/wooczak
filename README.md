✋ Hi, I’m Kacper from Kraków, Poland!<br><br>
👨‍💻 I’m mainly interested in Front-End Development, exploring it and improving my skills everyday!<br><br>
🌱 I’m currently learning vanillaJS and ✨ CSS with superpowers ✨ such as BEM methodology and Sass. My go-to is React, but I want to get to know Angular as well.<br><br>

What have I used and encountered up to this point?<br><br>
     👉🏻  Semantic **HTML5** (with deepdiving into Emmet in VSCode to make my workflow faster and more effective)<br>
     👉🏻  Basic and more advanced **CSS3** (CSS Grid, Flexbox, media queries, CSS variables, **Sass** - overall trying to make the code as clean as possible)<br>
     👉🏻  **VanillaJS** (DOM manipulation, Async/Await (and XHR), ES6+ JS; now learning Try...Catch Error Handling + CRUD Front-End with Babel & webpack later on)<br>
     👉🏻  Basics of **Git** and using the **Terminal**<br>
     👉🏻  Simultaneously working on **Python** basics (mainly regarding creating Bioinformatics programs)<br><br>
     
What I want to get to know in the foreesable future?
     👉🏻 React.js / React Native
     👉🏻 Boostrap
     👉🏻 TypeScript<br><br>

Nice to see you here!<br>
Have a great day
