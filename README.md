✋ Hi, I’m Kacper Łuczak - for everyone to know how to pronounce my last name I've Englished it to my login @wooczak.<br><br>
👨‍💻 I’m mainly interested in Front-End Development, but want to expand my knowledge towards Back-End in the foreseeable future (nodeJS!).<br><br>
🌱 I’m currently learning vanillaJS and ✨ CSS "facilitators" ✨ such as BEM methodology and SCSS. My go-to is React, but I also want to get to know Angular.<br><br>

💻 I've been coding for more than a year now, mainly pumping out as much as possible from vanillaCSS3 + semantic HTML5. Having met vanillaJS and SCSS, I found many great ways to imply my ideas to the websites I make in an easier and clearer way - I've already created three commercial WWWs for my closest friends. They were the best sandboxes for improving my knowledge and I can't wait to create more!
